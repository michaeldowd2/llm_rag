As corporations\\xa0and businesses turn toward exploring the decentralized ledger technology, more and more work is being carried out by developers.

The law of supply and demand states that when demand for a product or service increases, so does its price. Conversely, when demand decreases, prices also decrease. This principle applies to prices as well.\\nWhen more people buy ETH than sell it, this drives up the price due to increased demand. When investors become bullish on Ethereum’s future prospects, they are more likely to buy ETH in anticipation of future appreciation in value. On the other hand, when investors become bearish on Ethereum’s prospects, they may sell their holdings which can drive down ETH prices as a result of decreased demand.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Data\\\\Code\\\\llm_rag\\\\output\\\\test\\\\html\\\\ethereum\\\\increase_search\\\\2.html', 'title': 'What Factors Have an Impact on Ethereum Price?'}),\n",
