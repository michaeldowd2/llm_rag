                "explanation": "The context mentions that Crude Oil has decreased by 1.96 USD/BBL since the beginning of 2025, and it is expected to trade at 70.28 USD/BBL by the end of this quarter. Additionally, analysts expect the price to decrease further in the next two years, with an average of 71.87 in 12 months time. The potential for prices to exceed the current forecast is related to unplanned production disruptions, which could lead to a realignment of the oil price with its fundamental level."
